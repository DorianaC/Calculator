# Calculator
A easy small calculator in reactjs.
Install it using 
`npm install`

Run it using
`npm start`

# Components
The App component renders the display and the buttons and calls the 
calculate function on a click on a button.

# Logic
We send the current state and the clicked button to calculate the
result and save it to the state.
